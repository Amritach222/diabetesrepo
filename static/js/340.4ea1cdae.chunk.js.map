Some people donot notice any symptoms at all. Type 2 diabetes usually starts when you’re an adult, though more and more children and teens are developing it. Because symptoms are hard to spot, it is important to know the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Make sure to visit your doctor if you have any of them.\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div>\n    <h2>\n    Symptoms of Gestational Diabetes\n    </h2>\n    <br/>\n    Gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) usually doesn’t have any symptoms.
