You will absorb insulin the most evenly when you inject it into your belly. The next best places to inject it are your arms, thighs, and buttocks. Make it a habit to inject insulin at the same general area of your body, but change up the exact injection spot. This helps lessen scarring under the skin.\n                          <br/>\n                          <br/>\n                          Inhaled insulin, insulin pumps, and a quick-acting insulin device are also available.\n                        </div>\n<br/>\n                        <div>\n<h2>\nWhat Type of Insulin Is Best for My Diabetes?\n</h2>\n<br/>\nYour doctor will work with you to prescribe the type of insulin that is best for you and your diabetes. Making that choice will depend on many things, including:\n<br/>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n  How you respond to insulin. (How long it takes the body to absorb it and how long it remains active varies from person to person.)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n  Lifestyle choices. The type of food you eat, how much alcohol you drink, or how much exercise you get will all affect how your body uses insulin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n  Your willingness to give yourself multiple injections per day\n  </li>\n  <li>\n  How often you check your blood sugar\n  </li>\n  <li>\n  Your age\n  </li>\n  <li>\n  Your goals for managing your blood sugar\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nYour doctor may prescribe more than one type. You might need to take insulin more than once daily, to space your doses throughout the day, or to add other medicines.\n<br/>\n\nAfrezza, a rapid-acting inhaled insulin, is FDA-approved for use before meals for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The drug peaks in your blood in about 15-20 minutes and it clears your body in 2-3 hours. It must be used along with long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes.\n<br/>\n\nThe chart below lists the types of injectable insulin with details about onset (the length of time before insulin reaches the bloodstream and begins to lower blood sugar), peak (the time period when it best lowers blood sugar) and duration (how long insulin continues to work). These three things may vary. The final column offers some insight into the coverage provided by the different insulin types in relation to mealtime.\n\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div>\n                          <h2>\n                          How Are Doses Scheduled?\n                          </h2>\n                          <br/>\n                          Follow guidelines of your doctor on when to take your insulin. The time span between your shot and meals may vary depending on the type you use.\n                          <br/>\n                          In general, though, you should coordinate your injection with a meal. You want to time your shot so that the glucose from your food gets into your system at about the same time that the insulin starts to work. This will help your body use the glucose and avoid low blood sugar reactions. From the chart on page 1, the onset column shows when the insulin will begin to work in your body. You want that to happen at the same time you are absorbing food. Good timing will help you avoid low blood sugar levels.\n                          <br/>\n                          <br/>\n                          <ul>\n                            \n<li>\n<b>Rapid acting insulins:</b>About 15 minutes before mealtime      \n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n\n                            <b>Short-acting insulins:</b>30 to 60 minutes before a meal\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                            <b>Intermediate-acting insulins:</b>Up to 1 hour prior to a meal\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                           <b> Pre-mixed insulins:</b>Depending on the product, between 10 minutes or 30 to 45 minutes before mealtime\n                            </li>\n                          </ul>\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div>\n                          <h2>Exceptions to Insulin Dosing and Timing</h2>\n                          <br/>\n                          Long-acting insulins aren’t tied to mealtimes. You’ll take detemir (Levemir) once or twice a day no matter when you eat. And you wll take glargine (Basaglar, Lantus, Toujeo) once a day, always at the same time. Deglutec is taken once a day, and the time of day can be flexible. But some people do have to pair a long-acting insulin with a shorter-acting type or another medication that does have to be taken at meal time.\n                          <br/>\n                          Rapid-acting products can also be taken right after you eat, rather than 15 minutes before mealtime.

You donot need to refrigerate vials of insulin that you are using. A good rule of thumb is that if the temperature is comfortable for you, the insulin is safe. You can store the bottle that you are using at room temperature (not higher than 80 F) for 30 days. You donot want it to get too hot or too cold, and keep it out of direct sunlight.\n                          <br/>\n                          Keep your extra backup bottles in the refrigerator. The night before you are going to start using a new bottle, take it out and let it warm up. Donot let your insulin freeze.\n                          <br/>\n                          Always look at your insulin inside the bottle before you draw it into the syringe. Rapid-acting, short-acting, and certain long-acting types should be clear. Other forms may look cloudy, but they shouldnot have clumps.\n                          <br/>\n                          If you carry a bottle with you, be careful not to shake it. That makes air bubbles, which can change the amount of insulin you get when you withdraw it for an injection.\n                          <br/>\n                          For insulin pens, check the package insert for storage instructions\n                        </div>\n                        <br/>\n                        <div>\n                          <h2>\n                          Storing Inhaled Insulin\n                          </h2>\n                          <br/>\n                          Check the directions on the package.
