In this case, the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas are destroyed. Up to 10% of people who have diabetes have Type 1. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults (but can develop at any age). It was once better known as “juvenile” diabetes. People with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day. This is why it is also called insulin-dependent diabetes.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li><h6 className='heading'>Type 2 diabetes:</h6>  With this type, your body either doesnot make enough insulin or your body’s cells don’t respond normally to the insulin. This is the most common type of diabetes. Up to 95% of people with diabetes have Type 2. It usually occurs in middle-aged and older people. Other common names for Type 2 include adult-onset diabetes and insulin-resistant diabetes. Your parents or grandparents may have called it “having a touch of sugar.”\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li><h6  className='heading'>Prediabetes:</h6> This type is the stage before Type 2 diabetes. Your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be officially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.\n</li>\n<br/>\n<li><h6 className='heading'>Gestational diabetes:</h6> This type develops in some women during their pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after pregnancy. However, if you have gestational diabetes youa are at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later on in life.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<div>\nLess common types of diabetes include:\n<br/>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <b>\n    Monogenic diabetes syndromes:</b> These are rare inherited forms of diabetes accounting for up to 4% of all cases.
